## Defining Minimal Computing
Minimal Computing can be productivly oriented around answering the question: "what do we minimally need from computing to help us achieve our goals?" For Alex Gil, building any project using minimal computing principles means building computing projects, as Ernesto Orazo would call them, using ["architectures of necessity"](http://architectureofnecessity.com/). [^fn]: Alex Gil. 

"Computing minimally" means thinking about digital and public humanities projects in ways that reorient our thinking around ease of use, ease of creation, increased access, and reductions in cost, electricity, etc. Minimal computing projects strive to:

* Curb reliance on proprietary platforms and tools
* Increase awareness of ecological and social impacts of computing (storage, production, etc.)
* Demystify computers as tools of labor for workers in the humanities
* Lower barriers to access
* Increase ease and freedom of information/knowledge (as the products of our labor)
