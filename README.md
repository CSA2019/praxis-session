# Deploying Lightweight Digital Editions in the Community and Classroom 

## Defining Minimal Computing
Minimal Computing can be productively oriented around answering the question: "what do we minimally need from computing to help us achieve our goals?" For [Alex Gil](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/), building any project using minimal computing principles means building computing projects, as Ernesto Orazo would call them, using ["architectures of necessity."](http://architectureofnecessity.com/)

"Computing minimally" therefore means thinking about digital and public humanities projects in ways that reorient our thinking around ease of use, ease of creation, increased access, and reductions in cost, electricity, etc. Minimal computing projects strive to:

* Curb reliance on proprietary platforms and tools
* Increase awareness of ecological and social impacts of computing (storage, production, etc.)
* Demystify computers as tools of labor for workers in the humanities
* Lower barriers to access
* Increase ease and freedom of information/knowledge (as the products of our labor)

## Complicating "Minimal Computing"

We think it's vitally important to continually engage in critical reflection about our own practices and positionality when undertakeing any computing project. Critical reflection is especially important when confronting the overlapping concerns of culture and technology, since computing in the humanities in the 21st century has tended to be distorted by hype, for the sake of computing itself.

In his essay, [“Minimal Definitions"](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/02/minimal-definitions/), Jentery Sayers lays out a series of critical questions and cautionary reminders that might help guide our efforts to complicate the assumptions of minimal computing projects. Sayers encourages us to ask:

* How do minimialist aesthetics in computing marginalize and reify by projecting certain features as "essential" when we decide what is necessary in a digital or public humanities project? 
* How do we define the "we" in questioning computing projects, and how do certain knowledge barriers and material constraints or privelages prescribe our position?
* How do we account for the politics of control in DIY/DIO projects that intersect with computing (viz. seizing the [means of production](https://marxdown.github.io/texts/ch01/#the-two-factors-of-a-commodity-use-value-and-value--the-substance-of-value-and-the-magnitude-of-value) versus [possessive individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._B._Macpherson#Political_theories)?
* How do we understand the relation between creativity and labor (i.e., "creative action" a la Arendt) and how do our strategies or tactics play into conventionally binary distinctions like play/work, labor/leisure, and more of "what don't we need"?

When moving forward with any minimal computing project, what we’re interested in asking is: 

>*How can we leverage minimal computing principles to imagine new "architectures of necessity" (or projects that help give us what we need), while continuing to unsettle and to question the consequential dimensions of technoglogy for our labor and practice as workers in the humanities?*


## Building Digital Reading Editions Using Minimal Computing Principles

Digital Reading Editions vs. Scholarly Editions ... While goals are varied, each would seek to renew, disseminate and preserve  the scholarly or public record.

## Tutorial

### [I. Building a Jekyll site](/praxis-session/jekyll)

### [II. Editing & Writing with markdown](/praxis-session/markdown)

### [III. Using hypothes.is to Create Annotations](/praxis-session/hypothesis)

## Examples

#### Digital Reading Editions
* [MARXdown](https://MARXdown.github.io) a digital reading edition of Marx's *Capital Vol.1*
* [The Frankenstein Variorum](https://pghfrankenstein.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/) a digital collation of five distinct versions of the novel produced between 1816 and 1831. 
* [Aimé Césaire and the Broken Record](https://via.hypothes.is/http://record.elotroalex.com/) a work in progress by Alex Gil, using Ed. to publish a series of critical explorations of Aimé Césaire's work as well as several "speculative" editions of one of Césaire's early plays, *Et les Chiens se taisaient* (1958).

#### Digital Exhibits & Collections
* [Collection Builder-GH](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/) a template for creating small digital collection exhibits on GitHub Pages designed for teaching digital library skills.
* [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) A platform for creating digital scholarly or cultural exhibits with minimal resources by creating customizable static websites integrating image collections, video, sound and text.
* [Style Revolution](https://stylerevolution.github.io/) a digital exhibit created using Wax by the Department of Art History and Archeology at Columbia University.

#### Intellectual Project Spaces
* [Minimal Computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) a space for organizing, and collaborating on minimal computing projects, as well as for aggregating and sharing resources and ideas relevant to those projects.
* [Media and Materiality](https://jentery.github.io/cspt500/) Jentery Sayers' course website and syllabus for a class on media and critical theory at the University of Victoria.
* [sx archipelagos](http://smallaxe.net/sxarchipelagos/) part of the *Small Axe Project*, archipelagos is a peer-review online publication for born-digital scholarship and critical debate in Caribbean studies.
