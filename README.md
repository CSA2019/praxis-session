# Deploying Lightweight Digital Editions in the Community and Classroom 

## Defining Minimal Computing
Minimal Computing can be productivley oriented around answering the question: "what do we minimally need from computing to help us achieve our goals?" For [Alex Gil](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/), building any project using minimal computing principles means building computing projects, as Ernesto Orazo would call them, using ["architectures of necessity."](http://architectureofnecessity.com/) 

"Computing minimally" therefore means thinking about digital and public humanities projects in ways that reorient our thinking around ease of use, ease of creation, increased access, and reductions in cost, electricity, etc. Minimal computing projects strive to:

* Curb reliance on proprietary platforms and tools
* Increase awareness of ecological and social impacts of computing (storage, production, etc.)
* Demystify computers as tools of labor for workers in the humanities
* Lower barriers to access
* Increase ease and freedom of information/knowledge (as the products of our labor)

## Building Digital Reading Editions Using Minimal Computing Principles

Digital Reading Editions vs. Scholarly Editions ... 

## Tutorial

### I. Building a Jekyll site with Ed.+ hypothes.is

### II. Importing Your Own Text and Editing+Writing with markdown

### III. Going Live and Using hypothes.is to Create Annotations

### IV. Examples

#### Digital Reading Editions
* [MARXdown](https://MARXdown.github.io) a digital reading edition of Marx's *Capital Vol.1*
* [The Frankenstein Variorum](https://pghfrankenstein.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/) a digital collation of five distinct versions of the novel produced between 1816 and 1831. 

#### Digital Exhibits & Collections
* [Collection Builder-GH](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/) a template for creating small digital collection exhibits on GitHub Pages designed for teaching digital library skills.
* [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) A platform for creating digital scholarly or cultural exhibits with minimal resources by creating customizable statit websites integrating image collections, video, sound and text.
* [Style Revolution](https://stylerevolution.github.io/) a digital exhibit created using Wax by the Department of Art History and Archeology at Columbia University.

#### Intellectual Project Space
* [Minimal Computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) a space for organizing, and collaborating on minimal computing projects, as well as for aggregating and sharing resources and ideas relevant to those projects.
* [Media and Materiality](https://jentery.github.io/cspt500/) Jentery Sayers' course website and syllabus for a class on media and critical theory at the University of Victoria.
* [sx archipelagos](http://smallaxe.net/sxarchipelagos/) part of the *Small Axe Project*, archipelagos is a peer-review online publication for born-digital scholarship and critical debate in Caribbean studies.
