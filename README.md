# Deploying Lightweight Digital Editions in the Community and Classroom 

## Defining Minimal Computing
Minimal Computing can be productively oriented around answering the question: "what do we minimally need from computing to help us achieve our goals?" For [Alex Gil](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/), building any project using minimal computing principles means building computing projects, as Ernesto Orazo would call them, using ["architectures of necessity."](http://architectureofnecessity.com/) 

"Computing minimally" therefore means thinking about digital and public humanities projects in ways that reorient our thinking around ease of use, ease of creation, increased access, and reductions in cost, electricity, etc. Minimal computing projects strive to:

* Curb reliance on proprietary platforms and tools
* Increase awareness of ecological and social impacts of computing (storage, production, etc.)
* Demystify computers as tools of labor for workers in the humanities
* Lower barriers to access
* Increase ease and freedom of information/knowledge (as the products of our labor)

Of course, it is also crucially important that we continually engage in critical reflection about our own practice and position. This is especially when confronting the overlapping concerns of culture and technology.

In the essay, “Minimal Definitions” Jentery Sayers lays out a series of critical questions, and cautionary reminders that might help guide our efforts to complicate the assumptions of minimal computing: 

* How do minimialist aesthetics marginalize and reify by projecting certain things as "essential" when we decide what is necessary? 
* For that matter, how do we define the "we" of these questions, and how do certain knowledge barriers and material constraints prescribe this position?
* The politics of control in DIY/DIO (seizing the means of production vs. possessive individualism) 
* What is the relation between creativity and labor, (i.e. creative action a la Arendt) and play into conventionally binary distinctions like play/work, labor/leisure. ("What don't we need?")

Going forward then, what we’re interested in asking is the following: 

>How might we leverage minimal computing principles to imagine new "architectures of necessity" --i.e. **that give was what we need** -- while continuing to unsettle the potentially delimiting dimensions of technoglogy for our labor and practice as *workers in the humanities*?


## Building Digital Reading Editions Using Minimal Computing Principles

Digital Reading Editions vs. Scholarly Editions ... 

## Tutorial

### [I. Building a Jekyll site](/praxis-session/jekyll)

### [II. Editing + Writing with markdown](/praxis-session/markdown)

### [III. Using hypothes.is to Create Annotations](/praxis-session/hypothesis)

## Examples

#### Digital Reading Editions
* [MARXdown](https://MARXdown.github.io) a digital reading edition of Marx's *Capital Vol.1*
* [The Frankenstein Variorum](https://pghfrankenstein.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/) a digital collation of five distinct versions of the novel produced between 1816 and 1831. 
* [Aimé Césaire and the Broken Record](https://via.hypothes.is/http://record.elotroalex.com/) a work in progress by Alex Gil, using Ed. to publish a series of critical explorations of Aimé Césaire's work as well as several "speculative" editions of one of Césaire's early plays, *Et les Chiens se taisaient* (1958).

#### Digital Exhibits & Collections
* [Collection Builder-GH](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/) a template for creating small digital collection exhibits on GitHub Pages designed for teaching digital library skills.
* [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) A platform for creating digital scholarly or cultural exhibits with minimal resources by creating customizable static websites integrating image collections, video, sound and text.
* [Style Revolution](https://stylerevolution.github.io/) a digital exhibit created using Wax by the Department of Art History and Archeology at Columbia University.

#### Intellectual Project Spaces
* [Minimal Computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) a space for organizing, and collaborating on minimal computing projects, as well as for aggregating and sharing resources and ideas relevant to those projects.
* [Media and Materiality](https://jentery.github.io/cspt500/) Jentery Sayers' course website and syllabus for a class on media and critical theory at the University of Victoria.
* [sx archipelagos](http://smallaxe.net/sxarchipelagos/) part of the *Small Axe Project*, archipelagos is a peer-review online publication for born-digital scholarship and critical debate in Caribbean studies.
