## Defining Minimal Computing
Minimal Computing can be productivly oriented around the question: "what do we need to accomplish"[1](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/). As Alex Gil defines it, building any project using minimal computing principles means building projects, as Ernesto Orazo would call them, using "architectures of necessity" [2](http://architectureofnecessity.com/). This reorients our thinking around ease of use, ease of creation, increased access and reductions is cost, electricity, etc.
