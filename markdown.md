## Importing Your Own Text 
Once you've acquired a text you'd like to use to create a digital edition, you'll need to convert it to plain text before using "marking it down" to prepare it to be rendered for the web.

*Converting pdf's to plain text using Calibre*
*Calibre* is an e-book mgmt. software that is available for free, and allows you to easily convert pdf's to plain-text. 
* You can download it [here](https://calibre-ebook.com/).
>**NOTE**: The ease of this process depends on the condition of your primary text (hand-written or scanned pages will present further difficulties and require preliminary optical character recognition (OCR) work. *Calibre* will only work smoothly with pdf's that do not need to be OCR'ed.
* **DEMO**: Converting PDF to plain-text w/ *Calibre* (Raymond Williams, "The Future of Marxism")

*Scraping websites to create html files*...
Another option might be to locate a public domain online version of a text and scrape an existing website to receive the source information as a ".html" file.

This is what we did for *MARXdown* --using the existing text on [marxists.org](__) for *Capital Vol.1*. 

This method requires a bit more in-depth editing work on our part, removing all of the html tags and formatting, replacing hyperlinks, and essentially translating from html to markdown. But it also promised the ease of plaintext acquisition, i.e. we quickly acquired an open copyright plain text copy of the text in its entirety with out having to deal with OCR or file conversion processes.

## *Working with Text-Editors: Atom, Sublime, etc.*
Once you've OCR'ed your scans or documents, converted your PDF, or scraped your website for the underlying html files, you'll need to work in a text-editor to begin re/writing and editing the text in markdown.

* There are numerous options for this, some of the most popular include [Sublime](_) and [Atom](_), but you can also find several online "live" markdown editors, where you can copy and paste a plain text file, and begin to see your changes rendered as you make them.

>For today, if you already have a text-editor feel free to work in that, or otherwise -- grab the plain text copy of the Raymond Williams which I've dropped in the [repo](*link to file page*) and copy and paste it into this live editor: [markdown editor](link to markdown editor)--I will be working in *Atom* up here if you want to just follow along with me.
