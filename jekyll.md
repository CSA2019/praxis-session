## GitHub and working with the Command Line

Working in GitHub and installing some of the necessary components for running Jekyll requires a brief amount of work, up-front, in the command line -- however once this has been done, all maintenance can be done with the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/) GUI, and building a site with GitHub Pages without using a CLI at all, see link below.

* **GitHub** is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you build, store, manage and collaborate on digital projects with others from anywhere with internet acces.
    - For more information about getting started using GitHub see their [Hello World Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#what).
    
* **Command Line** -- To launch a Jekyll site you'll need to familiarize yourself with working in a command line interface. A Command-Line Interface, as opposed to a Graphical User Interface (or GUI), allows users to issue text-based commands to their computer through a terminal or "shell." 
 
* **Text Editors** -- In order to work with Jekyll to build a static website you'll need to use a text editor to view, edit, and save changes to the pages that compose your site's structure. 
    - We will touch on text-editors more in the next section, but if you're interested in building your own jekyll site you might refer to [this section](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#text-editor-) from Amanda Visconti's "Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages," full version linked below.
