## GitHub and Text Editors

* **GitHub** is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you build, store, manage and collaborate on digital projects with others from anywhere with internet acces.
    - For more information about getting started using GitHub see their [Hello World Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#what)
 
* **Text Editors** -- In order to work with Jekyll to build a static website you'll need to use a text editor to view, edit, and save changes to the pages that compose your site's structure. 
    - *stay tuned, we will cover more about text-editors in the markdown section*
