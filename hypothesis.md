### 1. Sign Up For a *hypothes.is* account
![hypothes.is1](/assets/img/hypo-image1.png)

Go to [the registration page](https://web.hypothes.is/start/). All you'll need to sign up for a *hypothes.is* account is an email address and a username. You should receive a confirmation email shortly--check your spam box if not.

You'll more typically be signing in through the annotation sidebar after activating *hypothes.is*. Optionally, you can also use *hypothes.is* to annotate any website if you download its [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek?hl=en).

### 2. "Go Forth and Annotate":

To try it out, navigate to [*MARXdown*](https://MARXdown.github.io) and sign in to your *hypothes.is* account.

Expand the sidebar to scroll through the existing annotations.

To create your own annotation, select text, click the "New Note" button--the other button is for private highlights.

Enter your annotation content in the composition window and click "Post to Public"--you can also click the adjacent arrow to make the annotation private or "Only Me":

>**NOTE**: You can always view all your annotations in a stream at your "My Annotations" page on *hypothes.is*:

Your annotations are editable and deletable there as well.

[Add images, links, and video,](https://web.hypothes.is/adding-links-images-and-videos/) or format your text using the editing buttons at the top of the composition window:

You can also make page-level annotations by clicking the same note button in the sidebar.

See [this blog post](https://web.hypothes.is/blog/varieties-of-hypothesis-annotations-and-their-uses/) for a full explanation of the different types of annotation that can be made in *hypothes.is*, including replies. For tips on best annotation practices (how much text to select, when and how to add images and links, etc.), check out [this page](https://web.hypothes.is/annotation-tips-for-students/).

### 3. If you have been instructed to annotate as a part of a reading group:

Follow the group link your organizer has shared with the group in order to join the group:

![hypothes.is9](/assets/img/hypo-image9.png)

Click the button to join the group--you may be asked to sign in first if you have not already done so:

![hypothes.is10](/assets/img/hypo-image10.png)

Next, navigate to the text you are assigned to annotate. Toggle the view finder in the upper left of the *hypothes.is.* sidebar to the group name--the default is the "Public" annotation layer:

Once you and your comrades have annotated texts as part of the group, links to those pages will appear on the group's home page as seen here:
